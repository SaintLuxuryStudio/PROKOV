# Descent into Darkness: My European Nightmare — complete film dossier

**Sorgoi Prakov begins as a grinning, naïve journalist filming a cheerful travelogue about the "European Dream" and ends as a grunting, blood-soaked cannibal whose camera degrades alongside his mind.** This French found-footage horror film, directed by and starring Rafaël Cherkaski, turns a Borat-style mockumentary into something closer to *Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer* — and it does so in a single, unbroken character arc filmed in chronological order over months, during which Cherkaski physically transformed his own body. Made for roughly **€10,000** and conceived as a student project in 2003 at the Beaux-Arts de Paris, the film was completed in 2013, premiered at the Cinémabrut festival, and slowly became an underground cult sensation in Europe before its worldwide streaming release on December 15, 2017.

## The character Sorgoi Prakov and the fictional nation of Sdorvia

Sorgoi Prakov is a television journalist from **Sdorvia** (also spelled "Sdorvie"), a fictional small nation described as sitting on the border of Russia. Cherkaski built an elaborate fictional universe around Sdorvia, complete with a constructed language ("Sdorvian"), a detailed cultural history stretching back millennia, a capital city called Kepta, a second city called Desko, and a backstory involving a 1984 coup d'état by a "General Kavshen" that turned the country into a forgotten authoritarian dictatorship. This lore is documented on the website **freesdorvia.com** and extends into Cherkaski's real-life music project **Sdorvia Desko**, a rap/electro group whose members pose as Sdorvian exiles and whose debut album *EP 01: BoomBoom Clandestin Mixtape* sold out all 2,000 copies.

When we first meet Prakov, he is irresistibly likeable — a nerdy, guileless man with a **dopey grin, thin mustache, and silly head-mounted camera rig** who speaks broken but charming English. Reviewers universally describe him as a "Slavic Mr. Bean" with the social obliviousness of Borat. He arrives in Paris equipped with two cameras (one head-mounted, one on a chest arm facing back at his own face) and a plan to trace a **heart-shaped route through European capitals** for his TV station back home. He edits footage each evening on his laptop, which explains the film's internal montages and cuts.

## Full chronological plot: from European Dream to European Nightmare

### Act 1 — The tourist phase (lighthearted, comedic)

The film opens with a title card reading **"My European Dream"** — though a brief flash-forward hints at the violence to come, seeding dread beneath the comedy. Prakov visits the **Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe**, approaches Parisians on the street to ask them about the "European Dream," and is met with dismissal, confusion, or outright hostility. He is denied entry to the **Louvre and the Centre Pompidou** because of his camera rig, prompting him to remark bitterly: **"As if tourists were terrorists."** He investigates Parisian nightlife, parties with locals, gets high, drinks heavily, and has the time of his life. Interactions with real members of the public feel genuinely improvised — many early scenes were filmed amid actual large crowds and what appears to be a real political demonstration, giving the film extreme naturalistic texture.

### Act 2 — The decline (misfortune, desperation, homelessness)

The first warning comes near the Pompidou Centre, where a tourist's camera is stolen by a thief and Prakov chases the man through crowded streets, weighed down by his gear. The incident is resolved when a bystander tackles the thief, but it foreshadows what is coming. One night, Prakov is **mugged and severely beaten by four men**, who steal one of his cameras. He is forced to spend his dwindling money on a replacement. He quotes himself in the aftermath: **"What happened?" "People, they broke my face. Yeah, bad place. Bad times."**

His financial situation collapses. He has been spending frivolously on French cuisine, alcohol, and drugs. He never leaves Paris — the heart-shaped European itinerary is abandoned entirely. His **producers back in Sdorvia stop answering his calls and emails**, leaving him stranded with no funds and no support. He abandons his hotel, falls into an existential funk, and becomes homeless, living on the streets. He grows increasingly antagonistic, picking fights with everyone he encounters. The European Dream has become a nightmare.

### Act 3 — The descent into madness (horrific, extreme)

The spiral begins with petty crime — theft, public defecation, stalking — and accelerates dramatically. **Approximately 50 minutes into the film**, on a drunken night, Prakov commits his first murder: he **stabs a homeless man and sets him on fire**, filming himself the entire time. This moment is the point of no return. He begins breaking into houses, stalking locals, and formally renames his project from a documentary about the "European Dream" to a document of the **"European Nightmare."**

From here, the film escalates through a series of increasingly disturbing sequences:

- **The bathroom mirror scene**: Filmed in near-total darkness, the screen shows nothing but flashes of a naked, blood-covered Prakov in front of a mirror, illuminated only by a flickering light switch. The film deliberately withholds explicit detail but makes the horror unmistakable through implication. One reviewer noted: "It doesn't show everything, but just enough to make you go 'WHAT THE HECK DID HE JUST DO.'"
- **Animal killings**: He kills several animals in gruesome ways.
- **Macabre puppet shows**: He performs disturbing puppet shows, a surreal detail that underscores his unraveling psyche.
- **Implied sexual violence**: Rape scenes are conveyed entirely off-camera through sound design, which multiple reviewers noted makes them even more disturbing than explicit imagery would.
- **Cannibalism**: Murder, pyromania, and cannibalism all come into play in the film's final stretch.
- **The final home invasion**: A climactic break-in sequence described by reviewers as leaving "a particularly sour taste in your mouth."

### The disintegration — language, body, and image

Three parallel deteriorations define the film's final act. First, **Prakov's language breaks down**: he reverts from English to his "native Sdorvian" (the constructed language), then to what sounds like speaking in tongues, and finally to nothing but **primitive grunts**. Music and imagery take over as the sole storytelling vehicles. Second, **Cherkaski's physical body visibly transforms** — the film was shot in chronological order specifically so the actor could be seen gaining roughly 20kg before filming began and then losing 30–40kg during production, growing his hair long and eventually shaving his head entirely. Third, the **video image itself degrades**: in the final 10 minutes, intentional glitches, pixelation, and digital artifacts overwhelm the screen, mirroring Prakov's total mental disintegration. The camera becomes as broken as the man holding it.

## Production history and the blurred line between actor and character

Rafaël Cherkaski — born in 1984 in Lyon, raised partly in France's overseas territories, and trained at the Beaux-Arts de Paris — first conceived the Sorgoi Prakov character in **2003** as a student project. He is a multidisciplinary artist who paints (under the pseudonym Alan Allio), performs with the street arts company Lucamoros, and self-describes as "an internationally touring expressionist and perversionist." His real name may be **Emmanuel Perez**, according to a French-language profile in Le Kiosque.

The film was shot on a budget of roughly **€10,000**, with crew members reportedly contributing their own money. Many interactions with the public were genuine or semi-improvised, with Cherkaski refusing to break character. Crew members have alleged that as filming progressed, **Cherkaski came to identify completely with the character he plays** — a claim that adds an unsettling meta-layer to the project. When later contacted about a Blu-ray release, Cherkaski reportedly refused interviews, handed over a pack of raw footage rushes, and vanished.

A companion documentary titled **"Searching for Cherkaski"** (2021/2022), directed by Rock Brenner, explores the director's life and blurred identity. It is available on Prime Video and MUBI.

Additional credits from Cherkaski include a segment in the horror anthology *Quarantaines* (2021), producing *CannibalCafe* (2022), directing the short *Détraqué* (2023), and an appearance in *Mother Schmuckers* (2021). A project called *Shreklife* is reportedly in post-production.

## Critical reception and thematic interpretations

The film holds a **6.1/10 on IMDb**, a **6.8/10 on MUBI** (26 ratings), and a **67/100 on TMDb** (45 reviews). Rotten Tomatoes lists zero professional critic reviews but strong audience praise. The most enthusiastic critical response came from **Grimoire of Horror**, which awarded a perfect **5/5** and called it "an astoundingly brutal depiction of naturalism" that "successfully creates a sympathetic connection between the audience and this charmingly credulous character, then unexpectedly forces this empathy to extend past the point of no return." The Bedlam Files described it as "an entirely unique and dazzling work of cinematic dementia that plays like Borat's psychotic sibling." Found Footage Critic called it "a slow burn that will reward patient viewers in the mind-bending final thirty minutes." HorrorBuzz characterized it as "a slasher film told from the perspective of the killer in a style not usually used for the subgenre."

Reviewers consistently compare the film to **Man Bites Dog** (1992), **Borat**, **Maniac**, **Creep**, **Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer**, and **Be My Cat: A Film for Anne**. The Italian horror site Horrornauta offered two compelling interpretive frameworks: an **allegorical immigration reading**, where Prakov's journey mirrors the experience of immigrants who arrive in Europe with hope only to find no support and fall through the cracks; and a **pre-existing mental illness reading**, where Prakov was unstable from the start and the film subtly signals this beneath his cheerful exterior. User reviews on Letterboxd capture the experience vividly: "Unbelievably good found footager, that starts like a Borat parody and then proceeds to get darker, then Darker, then DARKER... then JESUS CHRIST THAT'S DARK."

## Conclusion

What makes *Descent into Darkness: My European Nightmare* remarkable is not its violence — plenty of found-footage horror films traffic in brutality — but the **sustained, credible character arc** that precedes and contextualizes it. The film spends its first half making you genuinely like Sorgoi Prakov, an achievement that transforms the second half from mere shock into something closer to tragedy. Cherkaski's commitment to the role — the physical transformation, the refusal to break character around real civilians, the crew's reports that he merged with his creation — gives the project an authenticity that most micro-budget horror never achieves. The film's triple deterioration of language, body, and image in its final act represents a formally ambitious conclusion to what begins as a goofy travel vlog. For a €10,000 production conceived as a student project, its gradual accumulation of cult status across Europe and eventual worldwide streaming availability suggests it found exactly the audience it was made for — viewers willing to follow a smiling man with a camera strapped to his head all the way down into the dark.
